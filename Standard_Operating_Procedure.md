# Standard Operating Procedure for Water Management

## 1.0 Water Intake and Primary Filtration

**1.1 Purpose:** To ensure source water is free from particulates before entering the hydroponic system.

**1.2 Procedure:**
1. Activate intake pump (IP-101) when main reservoir level drops below 40%.
2. Monitor sand filter pressure gauge (SFG-01). Backwash if pressure exceeds 15 psi.
3. Record intake volume and time in the daily log.

## 2.0 pH Adjustment and Nutrient Dosing

**2.1 Purpose:** To maintain optimal pH and nutrient concentration for plant growth.

**2.2 Procedure:**
1. Measure pH of the main reservoir every 4 hours using pH meter (PHM-202).
2. If pH is outside 5.5–6.5, add pH up/down solution in 0.1 mL increments per 100 L.
3. Check EC (Electrical Conductivity) every 4 hours using EC meter (ECM-301).
4. Maintain EC between 1.8–2.2 mS/cm by adding concentrated nutrient solution A and B as per dosing chart.
5. Log all adjustments.

## 3.0 UV Sterilization

**3.1 Purpose:** To eliminate pathogens in the recirculating water.

**3.2 Procedure:**
1. Ensure UV sterilizer unit (UVS-401) is powered and flow rate is within 10–15 L/min.
2. Replace UV bulb every 12 months or after 9000 hours of operation.
3. Record UV operation hours weekly.

## 4.0 Discharge and Wastewater Handling

**4.1 Purpose:** To safely dispose of excess or contaminated water.

**4.2 Procedure:**
1. When reservoir exceeds 110% capacity, open discharge valve (DV-501) to the approved drainage line.
2. Before discharge, verify pH is between 6.0–8.0 and EC is below 3.0 mS/cm.
3. Document discharge volume and water quality in the discharge log.
